# Autonomous build progress log

Append-only. Newest entries at the bottom. Each firing adds: timestamp, items done, evidence, next.

---

## Bootstrap (operator session, before handoff)
- Caffeinated the Mac (~8.3h) so the session survives screensaver/lock.
- Created the autonomous scaffolding: STARTED_AT.md (8h window), BACKLOG.md (A→Z), LOOP.md (contract).
- Wrote deploy files: .dockerignore, Dockerfile (node:22-slim, build-time placeholder env so secrets
  never enter the image, `next start`), fly.toml (app huscribe-revenue-os, region fra, https, scale-to-zero).
- Scheduled the AUTONOMOUS BUILD LOOP cron (~every 25 min) to execute the backlog until 8h elapse.
- Next: D1 (create Fly app + stage secrets + deploy + verify login), then the docs + ports.
